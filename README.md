To run the application you have to install npm first

In project directory (where package.json lays) execute on console: 

1. npm install
2. bower install
3. tsd reinstall

check console logs for missing packages and install them with npm.

If everything looks fine you can build and start the application (on console again) with:

1. gulp
2. gulp serve
