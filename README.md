# Welcome to our Zühlke Github.io Site

This are the sources for the zuehlke.github.io repository.
This Site is where we present our contributions to the Open-source community. It is also the space where you can link your projects with Zuehlke. 

You will find all source files on the develop branch.
The master branch is only for distribution and contains the builded and minified files.

To run the application you have to install npm first

In project directory (where package.json lays) execute on console: 

1. npm install
2. bower install
3. tsd reinstall

check console logs for missing packages and try to install them with npm or bower.
If you got errors when executing "bower install" try to change to an less restrictive network (zred)
and try again.

If everything looks fine you can build and start the application (on console again) with:

1. gulp or gulp build
2. gulp serve


#How to get listed under "People" or "Repositories"

If you want to make your **substantial** contributions to Open-source Projects visible follow these steps:

1. Make sure that you are a public member of the Zühlke Open Source Community (https://github.com/Zuehlke/core/issues/6)
2. Clone the repo, change to **develop** branch, adapt the people.json and repositories.json files under "files", add your Picture under "assets\images\people" and send a pull request.
3. Your changes will be public after someone accepted your pull-request and merged the changes into the master branch (no automatized build yet)
