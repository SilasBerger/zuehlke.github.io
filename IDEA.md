Zühlke @ GitHub

What’s the idea of Zühlke on GitHub?

Some colleges assess the Zühlke Organization in GitHub to be much more important to the company's image than the zuehlke.com site. It speaks to the ability of the firm to extract and organize its assets (and those assets are code and knowledge) and showcases the much vaunted Zühlke culture. But Github is more than a code gallery. It's all about interaction.

To that effect we want to show our best side and that means projects/repositories that are active, are used internally and have reached a certain level of maturity. Furthermore we would like to see pull requests issued by the Zühlke account to show our appreciation of the software we're using in our everyday projects.

We want to keep the barrier to new projects and experimentations low, but we would also like the official Zühlke organization to fold-in such projects after they have reached a significant adoption.

Adoption ensures continuation and continuation is what we want to show in the Zühlke organization, not a handful of corpses and cruft. And to get adoption we need to post something useful.

Please take notice: At no point we are referring to code quality or correctness. We don’t consider these two as useful measures.

To keep this spirit over time, we would let the social pressures and publicity weed out the projects and be selective over what is hosted under the Zühlke organization.

What should be hosted on GitHub?

Code with more than three users.
Code that has been used in two client projects.
Forks of open source projects we have contributed to and have been used in our projects. (Regarding contributions: The individual commits could be with the employees' names but the pull requests through the Zühlke account.)
New Projects that intend to be public from the very first moment on and want to provide something useful.
What should not be hosted on GitHub?

We would like to avoid to use the public part of the Zühlke GH org as a convenient way to setup one-off repositories (like camp playgrounds) to exchange code for a limited time. A private BitBucket repository or a Stash repository would be a better choice.
Forks of established Open Source Projects originated at Zühlke just for the sake of documenting their relationship to Zühlke. These projects should just setup a bidirectional link between their GitHub pages and the Zühlke GitHub page.
OK, I have a candidate. What should I do?

If you don’t have an account, just create one on GitHub. Assign yourself to the “Z heads” group and ensure that your name is public. I shouldn’t be a secret that you work for Zühlke.
Contact XYZ.
Create a repository
Blablabla
What’s the maturity of the guidelines concerning GitHub?

The process is subject of change. We have to find the right balance between hosting only attractive projects and providing low barrier access for new projects. And we need to observe if the above rules are too rigid or too lax.

Furthermore we need to see this practically running for a while to be able to define sensible concrete rules for moving repositories to other places like Bitbucket or Stash.

How to get involved?

You would like to contribute to the organizational web site? You like to discuss the guidelines and rules? You are willing to help projects to get public?
